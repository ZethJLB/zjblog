description: "I attended the first week of Programming Principles 1, where we learned about Python Basic Syntax and Rules. Our professor emphasized the importance of understanding that computers are good at following instructions but cannot read our minds. We were introduced to GitHub, an online platform where over 83 million developers shape the future of software.

Our course outline, assignments, and course content were all available on GitHub. We were also provided with a Resource Handbook containing links to websites, videos, software documents, etc., that we would be using throughout the semester. We also learned how to install Python and Visual Studio Code.

In Python Basic Syntax and Rules, we covered variables, indentation, importing modules, and functions. I learned that a Python variable is a reserved memory location used to store values. Indentation is a style of code writing that structures programs, and it is used to structure the code of functions, loops, or blocks. Importing modules is done using the keyword import in Python. Python function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

We also learned about Python keywords and identifiers, where keywords are reserved words in Python that define the syntax and structure of the Python language. Our professor highlighted the rules for writing identifiers and reminded us that keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

Finally, we learned about the execution of a Python program, which involves the following steps: Compilation and Interpretation. The program is converted into byte code, which is then converted into machine code that is executed by the processor, with the results displayed.

Overall, the first week of Programming Principles 1 (#1) provided an excellent foundation for me to understand the basics of Python programming. I'm excited to learn more and apply what I've learned in future assignments and projects."
