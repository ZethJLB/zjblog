Our professor emphasized the importance of understanding that computers are good at following instructions but cannot read our minds. We were introduced to GitHub, an online platform where over 83 million developers shape the future of software. The course outline, assignments, and course content were all available on GitHub, and we were provided with a Resource Handbook containing links to websites, videos, software documents, etc., that we would be using throughout the semester."

Programming Principles 1 (#1) is an introductory course that teaches students the basics of programming using the Python language. In the first week of the course, we learned about Python Basic Syntax and Rules. 

Here's a recap of what we learned:
- Computers are good at following instructions but cannot read our minds.
- We were introduced to GitHub, an online platform where over 83 million developers shape the future of software.
- The course outline, assignments, and course content were all available on GitHub, and we were provided with a Resource Handbook containing links to websites, videos, software documents, etc., that we would be using throughout the semester.
- We learned how to install Python and Visual Studio Code.
- In Python Basic Syntax and Rules, we covered variables, indentation, importing modules, and functions.
- Our professor also highlighted the rules for writing identifiers and reminded us that keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
- Finally, we learned about the execution of a Python program, which involves the following steps: Compilation and Interpretation.

Overall, the first week of Programming Principles 1 (#1) provided an excellent foundation for us to understand the basics of Python programming. This knowledge will help us as we continue our programming journey and tackle more advanced concepts in the weeks to come.
